Booking Calendar Contact Form creates a booking form with a reservation calendar or a classic contact form, connected to a PayPal payment button.

== Description ==

With the **Booking Calendar Contact Form** you can create a **classic contact form** or a **booking form with a reservation calendar**, connected to a PayPal payment button. The reservation calendar lets the customer select the start (ex: check-in) and end (ex: checkout) dates.

The **reservation calendar** is an optional item, so it can be disabled to create a **general purpose contact form**.

There are two types of bookings available in the calendar configuration: full day bookings or partial day bookings. With full day bookings the whole day is blocked / reserved while in partial day bookings the start and end dates are partially blocked as used for example in **room/hotel bookings**.

Features:

* **Booking form** connected to PayPal
* **Reservation / booking calendar** with optional availability verification

* Supports **full-day bookings** or **partial day bookings** as used in hotels / room reservations
* Allows to disable/hide the calendar to convert the booking form in a **general purpose contact form**
